Info-Nation is a website created to be a central hub for both computer engineering professionals and students, as well as hobbyists who wish to have knowledge of practical applications of electronics. The heart of the developed website lies in the discussion of the notable equipment brands and trusted component retailers in the Philippines. Basic descriptions of the brands and retailers were provided, along with an option to visit their official websites. Additionally, available equipment and components were placed in a tabular format, together with the brand or product retailer that sells that material. A short description of the product and its corresponding price were also provided to further aid computer engineers in making wise decisions in relation to buying their needed products.
